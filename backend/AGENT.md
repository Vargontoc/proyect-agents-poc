## Layer Context
layer: backend
stack: Java 21 + Spring Boot 3 + PostgreSQL 16 + Liquibase + JWT
pattern: Hexagonal architecture (ports and adapters) per functional domain
does_not_own: UI components, Docker Compose, environment orchestration

## Package Structure
root: es.vargontoc.proyect.poc
per_domain:
    domain/model/       -> pure entities, no framework dependencies
    domain/ports/in/    -> use case interfaces (driven by application)
    domain/ports/out/   -> repository and external service interfaces
domain/service/         -> pure business logig, implements ports/in
    application/        -> orchestrates use cases, calls ports
    infrastructure/
        persistence/    -> JPA entities, repositories (implements ports/out)
        web/            -> REST Controllers (adapters in)
    security/           -> JWT filters, Spring Security config
    dto/                -> request and response objects 

## Migrations
tool: Liquibase
location: src/main/resource/db/changelog/
rules:
    - Never modify an existing migration file
    - Always create a new migration for schemas changes
    - Migration naming: V{version}_{description}.sql (e.g. 001_init_schema.sql)

## Contract
output: docs/contracts/openapi.json
rule: After any change to a REST endpoint, regenerate and update openapi.json
rule: Frontend depends on this file - breaking changes must be communicated

## Testing strategy
unit: JUnit 5 + Mockito - test domain/service in isolation
integration: @SpringBootTest + Testcontainers - test controllers with real DB
location: mirrors src/main/java structure under src/test/java
rule: Every port/in use case must have at least one unit test

## Skills Available
coding: backeckend/skills/coding/SKILL.md
testing: backend/skills/testing/SKILL.md
refactor: backend/skills/refactor/SKILL.md
design: backend/skills/design/SKILL.md

## Sprint Context
current_sprint: backend/sprints/current.md

## Workflow
1. Read root AGENT.md for global context
2. Read this file for backend context
3. Check backend/sprints/current.md - if blocked, stop and report
4. Identify task type (coding, testing, refactor, design)
5. Load the matching skill from backend/skills/
6. Follow the Agent Instructions in current.md for this sprint
7. Never hardcode values present in backend.env.example
8. After endpoint changes, update docs/contracts/openapi.json
9. Commit following: backend/type/short-description
