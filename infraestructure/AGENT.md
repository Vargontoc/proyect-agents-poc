# Layer Context
layer: infrastructure
purpose: Manage all environment orchestration, serv ice configuration and container lifecycle for local and production environments
does_not_own: application code, business logic, API contracts

# Environment Strategy
local: docker-compose.yml
production: docker-compose.yml + docker-compose.prod.yml (override)
env_files: infrastructure/envs/{service}.env.example -> copy to .env (gitignored)

# Services
backend:
    image: built from backend/Dockerfile
    port: 8080
frontend:
    image: build from frontend/Dockerfile
    port: 5173 (local) / 80 (prod)
db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    port: 5432
    volume: postgres_data (persistent, named)

# Network
name: app-network
driver: bridge
rule: All services must be an app-network, No service exposes ports directly to host in production except frontend (80) and backend (8080)

# Skills Available
coding: add or modify service in docker-compose files
refactor: restructure environment configuration
testing: validare containers start correctly and network is reachable
design: propose new infrastructure components or enviroment strategies

# Sprint Context
current_sprint: see infrastrutucre/sprints/current.md

# Workflow
1. Read this file and the active sprint in infrastruture/sprints/current.md
2. Load the relevant skill from infrastructure/skills/
3. Never modify backend/ or frontend/ source files from this layer
4. Never commit real .env files - only .env.example files are committed
5. After any change to docker-compose files, validate with: docker compose config
6. Commit folowing: /infra/type/short-description
